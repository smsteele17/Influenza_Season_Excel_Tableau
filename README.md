# Influenza_Season_Excel_Tableau
## Influenza_Season
This project is part of the CareerFoundry Data Analytics course that used data from the CDC and US Census Bureau using Excel and Tableau. 

## Objective
The United States has an influenza season where more people than usual suffer from the flu. Some people, particularly those in vulnerable populations, develop serious complications and end up in the hospital. Hospitals and clinics need additional staff to adequately treat these extra patients. The medical staffing agency provides this temporary staff and covers hospitals in each of the 50 states.
